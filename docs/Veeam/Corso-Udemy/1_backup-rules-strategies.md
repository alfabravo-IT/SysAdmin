# Backup Strategies and Rules with Veeam

## 1. Types of Backups

### 1.1 Full Backup
- **Definition**: A complete copy of all selected data and files.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Includes every file, folder, and system configuration selected for backup.
  - Serves as a foundation for other types of backups.
- **Advantages**:
  - Fast recovery, as all data is in one location.
  - Reliable and complete.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires a large amount of storage space.
  - Time-consuming to execute.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for initial backups or periodic archiving of all data.

### 1.2 Incremental Backup
- **Definition**: Only backs up data that has changed or been added since the last backup (any type).
- **Characteristics**:
  - Creates a chain of backups based on previous ones.
  - Tracks changes to avoid redundancy.
- **Advantages**:
  - Quick execution as only changes are processed.
  - Requires minimal storage space.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Recovery can be slow and complex due to dependency on multiple backups.
  - Vulnerable to failure if an incremental file is corrupted.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for frequent backups with limited storage resources.

### 1.3 Differential Backup
- **Definition**: Backs up all changes since the last full backup.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Depends solely on the last full backup, not previous differential backups.
  - Grows larger over time as changes accumulate.
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster recovery compared to incremental backups (requires only two files: the full backup and the latest differential backup).
  - Reliable in case of corruption.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Takes longer and uses more storage than incremental backups.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for balancing recovery speed and storage optimization.

## Comparison Table for Backup Types

| **Backup Type** | **Backup Size** | **Backup Speed**  | **Recovery Speed**  | **Dependencies**           |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Full Backup      | Largest         | Slow              | Fast                | None                       |
| Incremental      | Smallest        | Fast              | Slow (many files)   | All previous backups       |
| Differential     | Medium          | Moderate          | Moderate (2 files)  | Last full and differential |

## 2. Forward Forever Incremental Backup
- **Definition**: A backup method where, after an initial full backup, only incremental backups are created on a continuous basis. Over time, older incremental backups are consolidated into synthetic full backups.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Only one initial full backup is performed.
  - Subsequent backups capture changes made since the last backup.
  - Older incremental backups are periodically merged into synthetic full backups.
- **Advantages**:
  - Efficient use of storage.
  - Fast execution after the initial backup.
  - Simplified recovery through consolidation.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires software capable of consolidation.
  - Recovery depends on the synthetic full backup's integrity.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for continuous backup environments with frequent changes.

## 3. Reverse Incremental Backup
- **Definition**: A backup method where the most recent backup is always converted into a synthetic full backup. Incremental backups store changes relative to the previous state.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Synthetic full backup is updated to reflect the latest data.
  - Incremental backups store differences between the synthetic full backup and earlier data states.
- **Advantages**:
  - Fast recovery with the latest synthetic full backup readily accessible.
  - Efficient storage usage.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Complex to implement.
  - Performance impact during synthetic backup updates.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for systems requiring quick recovery and frequent backups.

## Comparison Table for Incremental Backup Methods

| **Aspect**            | **Traditional Incremental**            | **Forward Forever Incremental**        | **Reverse Incremental**                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Full Backup            | Periodically needed                   | Only once, initially                   | Synthetic full backup always updated   |
| Incremental Backups    | Stored without merging                | Merged into synthetic full backups     | Used to update synthetic full backup   |
| Storage Use            | May grow over time                    | Optimized                              | Optimized                              |
| Recovery Speed         | Slower (many files needed)            | Moderate                               | Fast (latest backup always synthetic)  |
| Complexity             | Simple                                | Moderate                               | High                                   |

## 4. Backup Rules with Veeam

### 4.1 The 3-2-1 Rule
- **Definition**: A backup strategy to ensure redundancy and resilience.
- **Principles**:
  - Maintain **3 copies** of your data: original + two backups.
  - Store these on **2 different types of media** (e.g., hard drives and tapes).
  - Keep **1 copy off-site** for disaster protection.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces risk of data loss.
  - Ensures recovery availability in different scenarios.

### 4.2 The 3-2-1-1-0 Rule
- **Definition**: An enhanced version of the 3-2-1 rule, incorporating additional layers of security.
- **Principles**:
  - **3 copies** of data.
  - **2 media types**.
  - **1 off-site copy**.
  - **1 offline copy** to guard against ransomware.
  - **0 errors** through regular backup testing.
- **Advantages**:
  - Protection against cyber threats.
  - Data integrity ensured through testing.
