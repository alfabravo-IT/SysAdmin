.SYNOPSIS
This script identifies and optionally removes ghost (non-present) network adapters from the system.

.DESCRIPTION
The script scans for ghost network adapters, which are network devices in an 'Unknown' or 'Error' state. 
It logs the detected adapters to a file and provides the option to remove them. 
The log file is saved in the same directory as the script with a timestamped filename.

.PARAMETER None
The script does not take any parameters. It operates on the local system.

.OUTPUTS
- A log file containing details of detected ghost network adapters (Name, Status, InstanceId).
- Console output indicating the progress and results of the operation.

.NOTES
- Requires administrative privileges to execute.
- Uses the `Get-PnpDevice` and `Remove-PnpDevice` cmdlets, which are available in Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later.
- Ensure that the script is run in an environment where `$PSScriptRoot` is properly resolved.

.EXAMPLE
# Run the script to scan for ghost network adapters and optionally remove them:
.\Remove-GhostNetworkAdapters.ps1

# The script will prompt the user to confirm removal of detected ghost adapters.
